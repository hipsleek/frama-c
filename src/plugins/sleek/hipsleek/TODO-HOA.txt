 - ADD ARRAY TYPE & TYPE INFERENCE MECHANISM FOR ARRAY & RELATIONS in astsimp.ml
     +  [Cpure.typ] : add Array type                                           DONE!
     +  [Cpure.get_exp_type] : add Array type checking                         DONE!
     +  [Astsimp.collect_type_info_pure] : cannot handle relation
     		Pass the prog as argument so that we can retrieve the types
     	of the arguments of the relation and array.     		 
     +  [Astsimp,Cast,Cpure,Iast,Ipure] : add empty array
     +  [Astsimp.trans_pure_exp] : make the correct type in translation.       IN PROGRESS!


 - HANDLE RELATION DEFINITION
     +  [Sparser.mly] : insist type decoration for relations and parse the type
     +  [Sleekengine.process_rel_def] : check for name consistency
     +  [?]  : handle relation definition by axiomatization, for instance,

                    relation sum(int a,int b,int c) == a = b + c.

               should be handled by the following SMT code:

                    (declare-fun sum Int Int Int Bool)
                    (assert (forall (a Int) (b Int) (c Int) ((sum a b c) = (= a (+ b c))))
                    
               Note that the program is not pass to imply_mix_formula ... and hence, this
               piece of information is not available to smtsolver. Hence, we have 2 options:
               1)   Change imply_mix_formula and its caller and everything it calls: pass the 
               program in addition to the formula to verify. This is a painful process because
               we shall have to modify all the prover's specific imply.
               2)	Add another field in smtsolver. In [Sleekengine.process_rel_def], we insert
               the relation definitions to the accumulated field in smtsolver.
