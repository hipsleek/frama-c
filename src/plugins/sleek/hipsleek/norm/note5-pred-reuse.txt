This is meant to determine
if U* can be expressed in terms of K*

 pred_reuse [U*][K*].

If we use:

 pred_reuse [U*][*].

It means to process the predicate in topological order,
and to have U* checked againts those before it.


If we use:

 pred_reuse [*][*].

It means to process the predicate in topological order,
and to have each predicate checked against the previous one;
and to maximise on reuse where possible.
