A. Problem catagories
1. not related

example:
extern int __VERIFIER_nondet_int(void); 
void bubble(int a[], int N)
      {
          int i, j, t;
          for (i = N; i >= 1; i--) {
              for (j = 2; j <= i; j++) {
                  if (a[j-1] > a[j]) {
                      t = a[j-1];
                     a[j-1] = a[j];
                     a[j] = t;
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     
     int main() {
       int* a;
       int n = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
       bubble(a, n);
       return 0;
     }
In this program, whether the program terminate or not is actually not related to the content of the array elements. So in this case we can just make array elements into anything else.

2. partly related
#include <stdlib.h>
      extern int __VERIFIER_nondet_int(void);
      
      int main() {
        int i, j;
        int val;
        int length = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
        if (length < 1) length = 1;
        int *arr = alloca(length);
       if (!arr) return 0;
       for (i=0; i<length; i++) {
         val = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
         if (val < 0) {
           val = 0;
         }
         arr[i] = val;
       }
       for (j=0; j<length; j++) {
         while (arr[j] > 0) {
           arr[j]--;
         }
       }
       return 0;

     }


In this case, there are two parts that have something to do with the termination inference. In the first part, it is actually not related to the array contents, so the array elements can be translated into anything; in the second part, the outer loop has nothing to do with the array, in the inner loop, arr[j] can just be represented as one normal variable.

Similar example can be found in svcomp_diff_usafe.c

3. totally related
      extern int __VERIFIER_nondet_int(void);
      
      void insertion(int a[], int N)
      {
          int i, j, v;
          for (i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
              v = a[i];
              j = i;
              while (j > 0 && a[j - 1] > v) {
                 a[j] = a[j-1];
                 j--;
             }
             a[j] = v;
         }
     }
     
     int main() {
       int *a;
       int N = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
       insertion(a, N);
       return 0;
     }
In this case, we have to strictly know that after the insertion, a[j-1] is greater (or less) than a[j].

It happens in all the insertion sorting cases.

B. Possible solutions:
1. For the first case, we can detect that there are not any arrays related to the loop ending condition;
2. For the second case, we can deect that an array element is used as one variable.
For example:
for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
	a[i] = 5;
} In this case, it doesn't matter that a[i] is represented by a_i.
But when there is something like a[i]=a[i+1]. we cannot simply do this.

C. Problem
To detect the behavior of the loop, we may have to go higher than the relational assumption level, such as going to the program level.
