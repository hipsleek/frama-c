For each heap predicate,
  HeapPred HP1(..).
  PostPred HP2(..).

We should internally create a corresponding pure 
relation:
  relation _pure_of_HP1(...).
  relation _pure_of_HP2(...).

Is this being kept in a dictionary?

After that, we should have a method which performs the
following

  pure_of_heap_pred :: h_formula --> formula_pure

  e.g. HP1(n)*HP2(w) ==>  _pure_of_HP1(n) & _pure_of_HP2(w)

  pure_relation_name_of heap_pred :: spec_var --> spec_var
      HP1 --> _pure_of_HP1

  heap_pred_name_of_pure_relation :: spec_var --> spec_var option
      _pure_of_HP1 --> Some HP1

This way we pass pure_relations in place of heap_pred for
infer pure to handle. Once it come back as:

     _pure_of_H1(x) & _pure_of_H2(r) & --> pure

We convert it back to heap-pred form:

     H1(x) * H2(r) --> pure

This would then allow us to pass to our relational assumption.
