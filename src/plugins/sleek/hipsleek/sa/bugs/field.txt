For the normalization, I think we need only push the
outer annotation inside if it is not @M and 
there exists a field that is not annotated as @M.

For example:

    P(@L,@M,@A)@L ==> P(@L,@L,@A)@M

    P(@M,@M,@M)@L ==> P(@M,@M,@M)@L

This way, we will still support node level
reasoning when it is feasible to do so.

However, during the entailment process,
we may have a mismatch of the form:

   P(@M,@M,@M)@L  |-  P(@L,@A,@A)@M

   P(@L,@L,@L)@M  |-  P(@M,@M,@M)@L

To deal with them, we allow normalization to
be performed during matching.
