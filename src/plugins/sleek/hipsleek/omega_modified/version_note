OC only supports file mode, it means OC receives input as a file and send the result to output device (a file or the terminal).
The pseudo code of main function is below:
 - show welcome message
 - read parameter
 - parse parameter
 - if (filename) begin
    - parse file content to get commands
	- process command one by one, cache the result
	- send all result to output device
  end
To communicate with OC through a channel, we should support additional interactive mode by stopping the cache. As the result, after processing a command, OC sends result to output device immediately.

The pseudo code of new main function
 - show welcome message
 - fflush(_ffout) //force to send to output device
 - read parameter
 - parse parameter
 - if (filename) begin  //file mode
    - parse file content to get commands
	- process command one by one, cache the result
	- send all result to output device
  end
  else begin  //interactive mode
    while (running) do
	  - read command
	  - process the command
	  - send the result to output device
	  - fflush(_ffout) //force to send to output device
	end
