/*
TODO : where is the Loop -> Loop scenario
It is hard to see which transitions are being checked.
I wonder if it is possible to write something like
  (OK) Loop  --> Loop
  (OK) Term[x] --> Term[]
  (OK) Term[x] & x=y+1 --> Term[y] 
  (ERR) Term[x] & x=y+1 --> MayLoop 
instead of the vague "The given variace is well-founded".

Termination checking result:
valid-1.ss_14_9: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
valid-1.ss_14_9: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
valid-1.ss_14_11: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
valid-1.ss_14_11: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
valid-1.ss_14_15: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
valid-1.ss_11_5: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
valid-1.ss_14_11: Unreachable state.
valid-1.ss_11_5: Terminating: The given variance is well-founded.
