5. Prepare benchmarks and evaluation
	- Change EVariance to Term in current examples
6. Simplify the context to add useful constraints for
meaningful printing.
7. Post-condition with Loop (partialy DONE)
	- Can MayLoop in a false context be refined to Loop?

===============================================
1. Clean up EVariance (DONE) and useless code of termination (DONE)
2. Add call group (from proc_call_order of proc_decl) (DONE)
3. Infer phase transition by inference mechanism (DONE)
  - Filter irrelevant phase constraints (DONE)
	- Make it work with interprocedural constraints (infer-3.ss), 
	may need logical vars (DONE)
	- Integrate the result into specification (DONE)
	- Aggressive inference for each scc group (DONE)
	- Implicit phase variables (DONE)
	- Do not add phase variables into a scc group if
	it only has 0 or 1 Term. (DONE)
4. Turn off termination checking when there is 
not any user-defined Term. (DONE)
