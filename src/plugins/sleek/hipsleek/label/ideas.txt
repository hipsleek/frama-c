say we have:

 (i)  e_1 = {a,b}
      e_2 = {b,c}

(ii) eq_all = e_1 /\ e_2
            = {a,b,c}
 
Then, for each e_i; we just want to
add just the difference

       eq_all - e_i

which can be computed using either:

   r_1 = exists (b: eq_all)  giving a=c
or r_1 = exists (a: eq_all)  giving b=c

   r_2 = exists (c: eq_all) giving a=b
or r_2 = exists (b: eq_all) giving a=c

This will ensure that we do not have
redundant constraints.
