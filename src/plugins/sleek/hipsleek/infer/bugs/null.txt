I think this can be done at tp-dispatcher
so that they need not be handle by other provers.

strong
======
x=null  --> x=0
x!=null --> x>0

weak
====
x=null  --> x<=0
x!=null --> x>0  (to avoid inequality)

// for simplifier
x=0 --> x=null
x<=0 --> x=null
x>0  --> x!=null
x>=0 --> true
x<0  --> false
