1. Decide on consistency constraints for field annotations.
   ex.

   ll<n, v1, v2> == self = null & n = 0 
	or self::node<a, q>@v1 * a::cell<_>@v2 * q::ll<n-1, v1, v2>@v1 
   inv n >= 0;

   usage: x::ll<n,v1,v2>@v3

   What is the relation between v1, v2 and v3?

2. Solve bug from ll-ann-param.ss with @M in postcondition.
 
3. Implement field annotations.

4. Add more examples.
