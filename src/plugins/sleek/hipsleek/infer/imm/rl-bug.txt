There is an insidious bug due to redlog prover
that is non-deterministic. For entailment (5) in
infer/imm/insidious.slk; it gave two different
results depending on the run/executions:

Entail (5): Valid. (bot)
<1>false & false &
{FLOW,(-1,0)=__false}

Entail (5): Fail.(may) cause:(failure_code=213)  v<:(@M) |-  v=@M (may-bug).


This bug need to be fixed or we will have a very
unstable verification system with redlog. Could it be
due to timeout or abort from redlog, this is being interpreted
as a "false" during unsat checking.
